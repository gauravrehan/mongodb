setup: we should be on ubuntu desktop (or vm) where minikube is running.

Install mongodb compass from here: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass

Check the health of mongodb pod whether it is running fine and accepting requests. below command should print the pod's port i.e. 27017:
kubectl get pod mongodb-64685c6576-9t4lc -n mfpocns --template='{{(index (index .spec.containers 0).ports 0).containerPort}}{{"\n"}}'

Next port-forward so that we can connect compass can connect to mongodb pod:
kubectl port-forward mongodb-64685c6576-9t4lc -n mfpocns 28017:27017

Open compass and enter connection string as:
mongodb://mongo:mongo@localhost:28017/?authSource=admin&readPreference=primary&appname=MongoDB%20Compass&ssl=false

There after you should be able to browse/create/edit the data in mongodb compass.

Also if we want to connect to mongo shell, then we can do so as this:
mongosh --username mongo --password mongo --authenticationDatabase admin

The data is persisted in vmnfs and remains intacts even after pods are replaced due to cluster restarts.
